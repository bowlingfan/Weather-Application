# Weather-Application
Creation of a basic Weather Application using Python with QT v6 and API calling (OpenWeatherAPI).

Creation of a basic Weather Application, with some quirks inspired by [CARROT](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/), a companion-based weather mobile application with some humor added as personality. Weather Application was created using Python with QT6 and API calls from [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/) (NWS) and [Geocode-xyz](https://geocode.xyz/). Features include:
- Selecting a location (Which can be saved!)
- Getting weather data at the "current" moment
- Forecasting weather for the next 7 days
- Showing warnings in the selected location if existent

## Notes
Only locations in the United States are valid for this program; any other locations outside of the US will not be accepted (due to NWS only providing data in the US)
Incomplete project. Will write the rest of the notes when completed. Screenshots will be provided as well upon completion.
